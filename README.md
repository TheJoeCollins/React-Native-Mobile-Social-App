# React Native Social App

#### Introduction

This is a summary of my private repository for a type of Social App I have been working on in my free time. My goal is to release this on the app store after I complete the list of minimum features for the service. To still show off my React Native experience I created this repository to show some of the features that I have included with in the app to date.

#### About

All of the covered topics I have taught myself just through continous and unrelenting desire to become one of the best programmers to date. Any advice at all negative or positive is much desired.
